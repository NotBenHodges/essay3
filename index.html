    <h1>Chapter 3 Essay</h1>
    <p>Chapter 3 discusses how data visualizations sometimes have to lie <br>
    in order to display data in a coherent form. When we look at data <br>
    visualizations, it is easy for us to misinterpret what is being presented<br>
    in the data. Once, I observed a bar graph that was measuring data on a scale<br>
    that was not realistic but had to be scaled that way in order to demonstrate <br>
    the differences in the data points.</p>
